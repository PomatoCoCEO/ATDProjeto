# ATDProjeto

Project for the Data Analysis and Transformation course from the Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra

## Description

This work consists of a series of files for data manipulation which allows predicting the activity a person is undertaking based on the accelerometer in their phone. For that, a set of 8 files containing training samples is used. The average DFT for each activity is calculated and STFT is applied to a given signal. The yield of this transform is then compared to the average DFTs obtained; and the closest one corresponds to the calculated activity the user is doing.
